The data has been collated into a master shapefile and separated into individual Phytophthora species shapefiles, and further separated into Phytophthora records on public and private lands. Data for positive Phytophthora disease points on private lands are restricted and managed in an internal separate dataset.\r\n\r\nDate: 20190124\r\nLineage: DBCA VHS and Murdoch University CPSM are laboratories that processes plant material and soil samples sent for Phytophthora analysis by the government, private businesses and community. VHS receive samples with a field data sheet which contains attribute fields including positional and plant disease information. Once a laboratory result from a sample has been determined, along with the field data sheet information, it is entered into the DPAW VHS database. Phytophthora species separate to cinnamomi are sent to CPSM for further analysis to determine species. The VHS Phytophthora database has started in January of 1982. Since 1982 samples have been recorded using various positional information formats ranging from Coordinate Reference System (CRS) unprojected AGD84 and GDA94 in both Longitude and Latitude Decimal Degrees and Degrees Minutes Seconds, and Projected AGD84 and GDA94 as MGA zones 50 and 51 UTMs. A VHS database extract of all Positive P. cinnamomi records including CIN, CIN A1 and CIN A2 with spatial coordinates have been collated and converted to GDA94 CRS to create a point shapefile. Coordinates, Barcodes, Result and Year are the main attributes used from the VHS database when creating a spatial point record. All records prior to 11/06/1996 do not have a barcode. Barcodes during and post 1996 can be used to reference back to DBCA VHS on request for the entire database record. DBCA VHS provide an annual database update to the DIDMS Administrator, currently South Coast NRM Spatial Information Officer as of January 2017, who filters, corrects and incorporates new data into the dataset.\r\nCompleteness: Complete at time of publishing\r\nPositional accuracy: GPS did not become fully operational to the public until 1995, but contained a scrambled positional error until May of 2000, was turned off to provide civilians with access to higher accuracy positional information. VHS records between 1982-1995 are estimated to have a spatial accuracy of +/- 200 m due to reliance on manual cartographic map grid plotting of disease sample points, and a technical lack of understanding between datums coordinate formats, ie decimal degrees and degrees, minutes, seconds. Arcgis 10.2 software and Google maps were used to convert and correct VHS data to a GDA94 CRS. VHS database records contain various location attribute fields. Records have an original Metadata statement template SCNRM Project Dieback 3 CRS type to base reprojection to GDA94. In doing so, data collected between 1982 and 2000 (4,558 records) has been corrected by repositioning points about 180 m to the NE of the AGD location, but due to hand held GPS not being common during this period with Department of Conservation and Land Management there may be up to +/- 50 m accuracy discrepancies with some of this data. Topographic maps and aerial photos were also used to estimate sample location during this period. From 2000 to 2004 there was a transitional period of records being collected in both AGD84 and GDA94. This data (2,345 records) has been corrected accordingly and accuracy increases with the common use of GPS is +/- 10 m. The remaining VHS records collected from 2005 to 2015 (5,253 records) have an increased accuracy with better GPS technology at an average of +/- 5 m and an ongoing GDA94 CRS standard. About 250 records have been corrected for positional data entry errors using additional label attributes from the field data sheets to realign points. As of June 30, 2015 for the total records on public lands being 11,144, an estimated 220 records will still have spatial errors due to data entry or field recording errors resulting in spatial inaccuracy of &gt; 500 m. It is estimated that about 98 per cent of records are accurate according there original spatial location field data entries. It is important to recognise the scale range of accuracy in the pre-mentioned periods being 1982 – 1995, 1995 - 2000, 2000 - 2004, 2005 - 2016, and data entry/field recording errors remain for 2 per cent of the records in the overall current dataset. Summary of Positional accuracy: - 98% data collected between 1982 – 1995 = +/- 200 m - 98% data collected between 1995 – 2000 = +/- 50 m - 98% data collected between 2000 – 2004 = +/- 10 m - 98% data collected between 2005 – 2016 = +/- 5m - 2% of all data +/- &gt; 500 m\r\nAttribute accuracy: Consistent","keywords":null,"bounding_box":"POLYGON((114.15 -35.12, 114.15 18446743673.71, 18446743673.71 18446743673.71, 18446743673.71 -35.12, 114.15 -35.12))","crs":"EPSG:4283","publication_date":"2020-12-16 12:49:21.957940","service_type":"WFS","service_type_version":null,"ows_resource":[{"type":"WMS","version":"1.1.1","endpoint":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","link":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true&srs=EPSG:4326&width=1024&height=1024&format=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=cddp:dieback_sample_points&BBOX=0, -90, 180, 90","protocol":"OGC:WMS","linkage":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","crs":"EPSG:4326","format":"image/png","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"type":"WMS","version":"1.1.1","endpoint":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","link":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true&srs=EPSG:3857&width=256&height=256&format=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=cddp:dieback_sample_points&BBOX=-20037508.34, -20037508.34, 20037508.34, 20037508.34","protocol":"OGC:WMS","linkage":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","crs":"EPSG:3857","format":"image/png","width":"256","height":"256"},{"type":"WFS","version":"2.0.0","endpoint":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wfs","link":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wfs?SERVICE=WFS&REQUEST=GetFeature&VERSION=2.0.0&SRSNAME=EPSG:4283&count=20&TYPENAMES=cddp:dieback_sample_points","protocol":"OGC:WFS","linkage":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wfs","crs":"EPSG:4283"}],"metadata_link":{"endpoint":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/","version":"2.0.2","type":"CSW","link":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/?version=2.0.2&service=CSW&request=GetRecordById&elementSetName=full&typenames=csw:Record&resultType=results&id=cddp:dieback_sample_points"},"styles":[{"name":"builtin","format":"QML","default":true},{"name":"builtin","format":"LYR","default":true},{"name":"custom","format":"SLD","default":true}],"legend":null,"tags":[]},{"id":17,"url":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/api/records/cddp:dpaw_bridges.json","identifier":"cddp:dpaw_bridges","title":"Bridges","insert_date":"2016-06-01T08:10:20.701753+08:00","any_text":"","modified":"2016-09-01 00:13:40.318065","abstract":"The DBCA Bridge Dataset comprises of information consolidated from various datasets, some historical and some current.

Each vegetation type has a unique structural and floristic description, and can be further grouped into vegetation formations. Full details about the classification and descriptions of the Vegetation Types are presented in Beard, J. S., Beeston, G. R., Harvey, J. M. Hopkins, A. J. M. and Shepherd D.P. (2013) The vegetation of Western Australia at the 1:3 000 000 scale Explanatory memoir Second Edition In: Conservation Science Western Australia-Vol. 9.\r\n\r\nDate: 20181211\r\nLineage: Using the Beard’s pre-European vegetation spatial dataset, vegetation associations were grouped into vegetation types, and then dissolved to create vegetation type boundaries. The vegetation formation, structural description and floristic description were then added to each vegetation type. Pre-European vegetation mapping is based on the project by A.J.M. Hopkins, G.R. Beeston, J.M. Harvey (2000). A database of the vegetation of Western Australia. Stage 1. Unpublished. The major sources of data in this database are the published and unpublished mapping of J.S. Beard at 1:250,000 scale. Mapping of the south - west corner was compiled by A.J.M. Hopkins from various sources. This data set originally derived in 2013 with updates as required. Last update Nov 2018.\r\nCompleteness: Complete\r\nPositional accuracy: This vegetation types dataset is derived from the pre-European vegetation mapping, and hence is dependent on the positional accuracy of this dataset. Original pre-European mapping was done on controlled aerial photo-mosaics scale 1:63:360 for the south-west and 1:100000 (some of which were uncontrolled photo-indexes) for the remainder of the state. This was photo-reduced to a scale of 1:250000 in the south-west and 1:100000 for the rest of the state for compilation. The original photo reduced maps an acetate sheets were digitized using Microstation and attributed in the Modular GIS Environment (MGE) at the Department of Agriculture. The dataset has subsequently been transferred to Geomedia Access Data warehouse and ORACLE Spatial data formats.\r\nAttribute accuracy: Vegetation types were assigned based on the vegetation association attributed from the pre-European vegetation mapping. The attribute accuracy of this dataset is therefore dependent on the accuracy of attributes in the pre-European vegetation dataset. Original pre-European mapping was carried out by plotting interpretations from field traverses onto the aerial photo-mosaics. Coded map polygon attribution from the original photo-reduced acetate plots was captured in the CAD and GIS environments described above. The current version of the dataset includes correction of original mapping errors and attribute capture errors. Please note that when in shapefile format, some vegetation type descriptions may be truncated if they exceed the maximum field length. Refer to Physiognomic_Veg_Types_Descriptions.xlsx for full descriptions. Also note that some descriptions contain regional references (for example, see vegetation type 4). If this dataset is not being used on a state scale, you may need to edit the legend and/or descriptions to remove references to regions outside your mapping area.","keywords":null,"bounding_box":"POLYGON((112.93 -35.13, 112.93 -13.73, 129.01 -13.73, 129.01 -35.13, 112.93 -35.13))","crs":"EPSG:4283","publication_date":"2019-10-21

(see Reported Populated Areas data). The depth of these zones is defined by fire behaviour characteristics relevant to the zone purpose. The 200,000 ha prescribed burning target is allocated between the three zones in proportion to the amount of Parks and Wildlife managed land (including UCL) within each zone. Land Management Zone-A • LMZ-A is nearest to populated areas, including Parks and Wildlife managed lands within populated areas. • The objective of management in this zone is to reduce the likelihood of ember attack on populated areas in the event of a bushfire, by maintaining fuel in a condition that will not give rise to extreme fire behaviour. • The depth of LMZ-A is the spotting distance of the average fuels in LMZ-B; meaning that spot fires generated by a fire in LMZ-B will not reach the populated fringe. Land Management Zone-B • The next concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-B. • The objective of management in this zone is to maintain an area within which a high intensity fire run could be arrested before it reaches LMZ-B. • The depth of LMZ-B is equal to the distance travelled by an ‘average’ bushfire in four hours, a period of time considered equivalent to the hottest period of an average day during the fire season. Land Management Zone-C • The third concentric buffer from the populated interface is LMZ-C, comprising the remainder of Parks and Wildlife managed land in the SWBRZ. • The objective of management in this area is to reduce the likelihood of the occurrence of large, intense fires in the landscape.\n\nLecense: Creative Commons Attribution\n\nTags: Land Management Zones, Presecribed Burns\n\nContact: dbca_gis@dbca.wa.gov.au","keywords":null,"bounding_box":"POLYGON((114.97 -35.07, 114.97 -30.97, 117.66 -30.97, 117.66 -35.07, 114.97 -35.07))","crs":"EPSG:4326","publication_date":"2020-10-19 16:06:28.909919","service_type":"WMS","service_type_version":null,"ows_resource":[{"type":"WMS","version":"1.1.1","endpoint":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","link":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true&srs=EPSG:4326&width=1024&height=1024&format=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=landgate:DBCA-059&BBOX=112.5, -45.0, 135.0, -22.5","protocol":"OGC:WMS","linkage":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","crs":"EPSG:4326","format":"image/png","width":"1024","height":"1024"},{"type":"WMS","version":"1.1.1","endpoint":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","link":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true&srs=EPSG:3857&width=256&height=256&format=image/png&SERVICE=WMS&REQUEST=GetMap&VERSION=1.1.1&LAYERS=landgate:DBCA-059&BBOX=12523442.712499999, -5009377.085, 15028131.254999999, -2504688.5425","protocol":"OGC:WMS","linkage":"https://kmi.dpaw.wa.gov.au/geoserver/wms?tiled=true","crs":"EPSG:3857","format":"image/png","width":"256","height":"256"}],"metadata_link":{"endpoint":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/","version":"2.0.2","type":"CSW","link":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/?version=2.0.2&service=CSW&request=GetRecordById&elementSetName=full&typenames=csw:Record&resultType=results&id=landgate:DBCA-059"},"styles":[],"legend":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/media/catalogue/legends/source/landgate_DBCA-059.png","tags":[]},{"id":864,"url":"https://csw.dpaw.wa.gov.au/catalogue/api/records/landgate:dbca_3_year_indicative_burn_program_dbca-009.json","identifier":"landgate:dbca_3_year_indicative_burn_program_dbca-009","title":"DBCA 3 Year Indicative Burn Program (DBCA-009)","insert_date":"2018-02-27T11:10:26.864418+08:00","any_text":"","modified":"2019-03-12 12:17:19.115857","abstract":"The Three Year Indicative Burn Program dataset depicts prescribed burns that are planned by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions to take place over the next three financial years.
